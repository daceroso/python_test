Design a test that ensures .docx files can be stored in the My Files section of FileCloud for a user and that multiple versions are stored.


Initialize variables for lower and upper limits of concurrent users (e.g., lower = 1, upper = 1000).

Define a function to test concurrent uploads with a given number of concurrent users:
a. Create a ThreadPoolExecutor with the specified number of concurrent users.
b. For each user, create a separate task to upload a file using the FileCloudPage instance.
c. Run all tasks concurrently using the ThreadPoolExecutor.
d. Wait for all tasks to finish and collect the results (success or failure).
e. Check if all tasks were successful. If yes, return True; otherwise, return False.

Define a function to find the maximum number of concurrent users before the system breaks using binary search:
a. As long as the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound:
    - Calculate the midpoint between the lower and upper bounds (e.g., mid = (lower + upper) // 2).
    - Call the test function with the midpoint as the number of concurrent users.
    - If the test is successful, set the lower limit to mid + 1 (the system can handle more concurrent users).
    -If the test fails, set the upper limit to mid - 1 (the system cannot handle as many concurrent users).
b. Return the maximum number of concurrent users (lower - 1) before the system breaks.

Define a pytest function to test the maximum number of concurrent users:
a. Call the find function to determine the maximum number of concurrent users.
b. Print the maximum number of concurrent users.
c. Verify that the maximum number of concurrent users is greater than 0.
